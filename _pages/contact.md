Data Science For Good is a group of Cal Poly students and faculty that are interested in leveraging their group knowledge of Data Science to have a positive impact. 

At this particularly uncertain time, our group would like to encourage small businesses and non-profits to reach out to us (though we encourage others to inquiry as well). We believe we can make a positive impact in this particularly difficult time.  Some ways we could be of service to you range from general technical discussions to more specific discussions of AI/data driven systems such as recommendation engines, sales forecasting, chatbot features for online interfaces, predictive modeling, and analytics. 

If you think we might be able to help: please fill out the following form and a representative will follow-up with you. We can't wait to discuss your particular situation.
